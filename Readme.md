# DSA in JavaScript

This repository contains my journey of learning and implementing Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using JavaScript. The goal is to build a strong foundation in fundamental DSA concepts and improve problem-solving skills for coding interviews and general software development.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

* **`arrays/`**: Contains implementations and solutions to problems related to arrays.
* **`linked-lists/`**: Contains implementations of various linked list types (singly, doubly, circular) and related problems.
* **`strings/`**: Contains implementations and solutions to problems involving string manipulation.
* **`utils/`**: (Optional) May contain utility functions or helper code used across different DSA implementations.

Each directory will contain JavaScript files (`.js`) with the code for specific data structures, algorithms, or problem solutions.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository (Optional):** If you want to contribute or keep track of changes using Git, you can clone this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd dsa-javascript
    ```
    (Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your Git repository if you choose to create one on platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.)

2.  **Navigate to the Repository:** If you didn't clone, navigate to the `dsa-javascript` folder you created:
    ```bash
    cd dsa-javascript
    ```

## Running the Code

You can run the JavaScript files in this repository using Node.js, which should be installed on your system.

1.  **Open VS Code:** Open the `dsa-javascript` folder in Visual Studio Code.

2.  **Open a JavaScript File:** Navigate to the file you want to run (e.g., `arrays/array-reversal.js`) in the Explorer panel.

3.  **Run in the Terminal:** Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (View -> Terminal or Ctrl+\`). Make sure the terminal is in the root of your `dsa-javascript` folder. Then, execute the file using the `node` command:
    ```bash
    node arrays/array-reversal.js
    node linked-lists/singly-linked-list.js
    node strings/string-operations.js
    ```
    The output will be displayed in the terminal.

4.  **Using Code Runner (Recommended):** If you have the "Code Runner" extension installed in VS Code, you can simply open a JavaScript file and click the "Run" button (play icon) in the top-right corner, or right-click in the editor and select "Run Code". The output will appear in the Output panel.

## Contributing

(Optional) If you plan to collaborate or want to keep track of your progress with Git:

1.  Initialize a Git repository in the root of your project (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git init
    ```
2.  Add your files:
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
3.  Commit your initial changes:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial commit: Setting up DSA repository"
    ```

## License

(Optional) You can add a license file (e.g., MIT License) to specify how others can use your code.

**Repository Description:**

This JavaScript repository serves as a personal learning space dedicated to mastering Data Structures and Algorithms. It contains implementations of fundamental data structures like arrays and linked lists, along with algorithms for common operations such as reversal and manipulation. The repository is organized by topic, making it easy to navigate and focus on specific areas of DSA. The code is written in JavaScript and is intended to be run using Node.js within a development environment like Visual Studio Code. This project aims to build a strong understanding of DSA concepts through hands-on implementation and problem-solving practice.
